# DFESW13-Final-Project
Bootcamp project

This Project is part of the final deliverable portion of the QA Academy bootcamp, intended to test knowledge in Java and many areas covered throughout the length of the bootcamp.

I expected this to go well and expected to complete the brief and fulfil any requirements inside of it to the best of my ability.

I did indeed complete the brief and most of its requirements, I created a Student Database that has full CRUD functionality and has information on the roll, name, address etc of a student. This could easily be implemented and used by a School or University to keep their studentâ€™s information accessible and easily updateable. I have tested that the CRUD functionality works through Postman and data does indeed update through MySQL.

My biggest issue was testing this project, I think that is my weakest area throughout the bootcamps duration. However, it is also an area that I will expand my knowledge on to further to test this project. My overall coverage is very low, but I do plan on implementing tests to this project over the coming weeks, as testing is something I can implement post-project. But, my current project has limited coverage.

Below are links to my Postman POST,GET,PUT and DELETE's. All data was accepted with status code 200 ("OK").
